  "description": "This project's development was an intriguing process, and various prototypes were being made. MRuby and the fact that it can be used virtually anywhere astound me. I intended to create an API that would allow JS code to easily access the Ruby API. It's designed to give me access to Ruby functions that facilitate work.",
